# Start Files

## Setup

Open this `starter-files` or `completed-files` directory in your code editor.

Run the following from the command line:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a server on `https://localhost:3000` and update with changes to your JS.

To stop the server run the following:

```
cntrl C
```

## Main Files

There are two main directories:

- completed-files - What we will end up with after the video
- starter-files - What you should start with to follow along

There are several files we will work with

- `src/index.js` - Main JavaScript file to kick off the project
- `src/config.js` - Contains IDs from UI in one place for easy, repeat access
- `src/helpers.js` - Helper files for getting, creating, removing and checking if DOM elements are rendered
- `src/state.js` - Up to date record of changable data in our app plus a helper function to update this data

## To Do

- Open the `starter-files` and run `npm install` and `npm start` to get things going
- Open the `src/index.js` in your editor
- Import and log out `state` and `stateRender` from `src/state.js`
- Import and log out getEl, createEl, removeEl, isRendered from `src/helpers.js`;
- Import and log out all of the UI ids from `src/helpers.js`;
